# Lets-find-the-rows-Required

Given an array A representing heights of students. All the students are asked to stand in rows. The students arrive by one, sequentially (as their heights appear in A). For the i-th student, if there is a row in which all the students are taller than A[i], the student will stand in one of such rows. If there is no such row, the student will create a new row. Your task is to find the minimum number of rows created.

Write a function that, given a non-empty array A containing N integers, denoting the heights of the students, returns the minimum number of rows created.
